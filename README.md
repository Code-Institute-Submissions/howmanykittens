<h1 color=pink>How Many Kittens? </h1>
<h2><i>The cutest way to visualise the amount of weight you have lost!</i></h2>

<small>(See demo <a href="https://oliviatatum.github.io/howmanykittens/">here</a>)</small>


How Many Kittens? is a website for converting the amount of weight the user has lost into kittens!
It can be hard to visualise what it means to have lost 1lb, 2lb, 3lb... so How Many Kittens? provides a cute way to put the number on the scale into something easier (and cuter!) to picture.
The user has the option of inputting their weight loss in pounds or kilograms, and then they can see the "kittens-worth" appear in a basket one by one!


<h2><b>UX</b></h2>
Inspired by my own weight loss journey (and four cats), I wanted to make a website which would help people visualise their weightloss. 
As such, <i>How Many Kittens?</i> is aimed at people who are trying to lose weight. <i>How Many Kittens?</i> is a cute way to envisage 
lbs or kgs, and serves as a good motivator to continue healthy weightloss - more weight lost towards your goal = more kittens!

<pre><h4>User Stories</h4>
<b><i>Claire</i></b>

Claire is a woman in her early thirties who is trying to lose weight for her health. 
She sees she has lost 7lb but doesn't really know what that actually <i>means</i>.
She tries <i>How Many Kittens?</i> and in just a couple of clicks she can see that she has lost 14 kittens worth of weight! 
Having seen and held kittens, she finds this puts her weight loss into a much better perspective in her mind. 
She feels proud and motivated. 'That's a lot of kittens! Lets see how many more I can get.'

<b><i>Max</i></b>

Max is nine years old, and his mum has been told by a doctor that he needs to lose weight. 
She is trying to keep things fun while making changes to help the family live a healthier life.
Once a week Max weighs himself, and they go on <i>How Many Kittens?</i> together to see just how
many kittens he has "won" this week. It's a fun activity that they both look forward to, and
his mum uses it as a motivator for him when he is complaining about eating a healthy meal:
"Are we going to get more kittens this week?".

<h2><b>Features</b></h2>
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

<h2><b>JQuery</b></h2>
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<h2><b>Deployment</b></h2>
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
